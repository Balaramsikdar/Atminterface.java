An ATMInterface in java having user name and password while entering and having following operations like transaction history,withdraw,deposit,transfer and quit.
I have created it in my first internship it is interactive with the users as well like desposit amound added will be reflected even show you how much balance you are having and if the password  is wrong it will give you an error.
